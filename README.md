# Cuisines-Classification-by-Ingredients
The basis of this project is formed by two datasets which obtain a listing of the ingredients used for dishes of different cuisines. In file *cusine_classification* (both available as [cusine_classification.html](cusine_classification.html) and [cusine_classification.ipynb](cusine_classification.ipynb), we show the processing and analysis of the data as well as the classification of dishes to country-specific cuisines based on their ingredients.
