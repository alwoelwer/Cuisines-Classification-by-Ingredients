# Cuisines-Classification-by-Ingredients
In *cusine_classification* (available as [cusine_classification.html](cusine_classification.html) and [cusine_classification.ipynb](cusine_classification.ipynb)), we show the processing and analysis of two datasets which contain ingredients of dishes of different cuisines. Furthermore, we apply classification algorithms to classify dishes to country-specific cuisines based on their ingredients.
